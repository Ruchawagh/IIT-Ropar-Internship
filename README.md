<h4>About  the Project:</h4>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent:5em\"> Hybrid energy system is entitled  for producig energy power from different energy sources like wind, sun,  battery .Telecom towers are essential infrastructure for enabling seamless communication services and data \n",
    "connectivity in rural areas. However, these towers often face significant challenges due to unreliable \n",
    "and insufficient power supply from traditional electrical grids. To address this issue, this report \n",
    "proposes the design and implementation of a Hybrid Off-Grid Energy System capable of providing a \n",
    "continuous and efficient power output ranging from 25 kW to 250 kW, catering to the varying power \n",
    "demands of telecom towers in rural regions in texas. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent:sem\">The design requires consideration of all possible energy sources and energy conversion \n",
    "alternatives in the development of a hybrid system.</p>\n",
